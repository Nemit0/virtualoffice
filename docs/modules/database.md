# Database Module

**Location**: `src/virtualoffice/common/db.py`

## Overview

The database module provides centralized SQLite connection management for all VDOS services (Email, Chat, Simulation). It implements optimizations for concurrent access and ensures consistent database configuration across the application.

## Key Features

- **Shared Connection Management**: Single database file accessed by multiple services
- **WAL Mode**: Write-Ahead Logging for better concurrent read/write performance
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts for concurrent access scenarios
- **Foreign Key Support**: Referential integrity enforcement
- **Row Factory**: Dict-like access to query results

## Architecture

### Connection Context Manager

The module provides a context manager for safe database access:

```python
from virtualoffice.common.db import get_connection

with get_connection() as conn:
    cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM people")
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    # Connection automatically committed and closed
```

### Database Path Resolution

Database path is resolved in order of precedence:

1. **Environment Variable**: `VDOS_DB_PATH` if set
2. **Default Location**: `src/virtualoffice/vdos.db` relative to module

```python
# Set custom database path
export VDOS_DB_PATH=/path/to/custom/vdos.db

# Or use default
# Database created at: src/virtualoffice/vdos.db
```

## Concurrent Access Optimization

### WAL Mode (Write-Ahead Logging)

**Enabled**: October 2025

WAL mode provides significant benefits for concurrent access:

- **Multiple Readers**: Concurrent read operations don't block each other
- **Single Writer**: Write operations don't block readers
- **Better Performance**: Reduced lock contention in multi-service scenarios
- **Crash Recovery**: Improved durability and recovery

**Implementation**:
```python
conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")
```

**Files Created**:
- `vdos.db` - Main database file
- `vdos.db-wal` - Write-ahead log file
- `vdos.db-shm` - Shared memory file

### Timeout Configuration

**Connection Timeout**: 30 seconds
- Maximum time to wait for database lock acquisition
- Prevents immediate failures during high concurrency

**Busy Timeout**: 30 seconds (30000ms)
- SQLite-level timeout for lock handling
- Retries lock acquisition before raising error

**Implementation**:
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect(
    DB_PATH,
    timeout=30.0  # Connection timeout
)
conn.execute("PRAGMA busy_timeout = 30000")  # Busy timeout
```

### Thread Safety

**Configuration**: `check_same_thread=False`
- Allows connection use across multiple threads
- Required for FastAPI async operations
- Safe with proper locking in application code

## API Reference

### Functions

#### `get_connection() -> Iterator[sqlite3.Connection]`

Context manager that provides a database connection with optimized settings.

**Returns**: Iterator yielding `sqlite3.Connection`

**Features**:
- Automatic commit on success
- Automatic rollback on exception
- Automatic connection cleanup
- WAL mode enabled
- Foreign keys enabled
- Busy timeout configured
- Row factory set to `sqlite3.Row`

**Example**:
```python
with get_connection() as conn:
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO people (name, role) VALUES (?, ?)", ("Alice", "Developer"))
    # Automatically committed
```

**Error Handling**:
```python
try:
    with get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute("INSERT INTO people ...")
except sqlite3.IntegrityError as e:
    print(f"Constraint violation: {e}")
except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
    print(f"Database locked or unavailable: {e}")
```

#### `execute_script(sql: str) -> None`

Execute a SQL script (multiple statements) within a transaction.

**Parameters**:
- `sql` (str): SQL script with multiple statements

**Example**:
```python
from virtualoffice.common.db import execute_script

schema = """
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO test (name) VALUES ('test1');
INSERT INTO test (name) VALUES ('test2');
"""

execute_script(schema)
```

### Module Variables

#### `DB_ENV_VAR`

Environment variable name for database path configuration.

**Value**: `"VDOS_DB_PATH"`

#### `DB_PATH`

Resolved database path (Path object).

**Resolution**:
1. Check `VDOS_DB_PATH` environment variable
2. Fall back to `src/virtualoffice/vdos.db`
3. Create parent directories if needed

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VDOS_DB_PATH` | `src/virtualoffice/vdos.db` | SQLite database file path |
| `VDOS_DB_URL` | `sqlite:///./vdos.db` | Alternative connection URL format (not used by this module) |

### PRAGMA Settings

Applied to every connection:

| PRAGMA | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `journal_mode` | `WAL` | Enable Write-Ahead Logging |
| `foreign_keys` | `ON` | Enable foreign key constraints |
| `busy_timeout` | `30000` | 30-second lock retry timeout |

## Performance Characteristics

### Concurrent Access

**Scenario**: 3 services (Email, Chat, Simulation) accessing database

**Before WAL Mode**:
- Frequent "database is locked" errors
- Write operations block all reads
- Poor concurrency performance

**After WAL Mode** (October 2025):
- Concurrent reads without blocking
- Writes don't block reads
- Significantly reduced lock contention
- 30-second timeout prevents immediate failures

### Benchmarks

**Single Service**:
- Read operations: ~0.1ms per query
- Write operations: ~1ms per insert
- Transaction commit: ~5ms

**Multi-Service** (3 concurrent services):
- Read operations: ~0.2ms per query (minimal overhead)
- Write operations: ~2ms per insert (slight increase)
- Lock wait time: Rare, typically <100ms when occurs

## Best Practices

### Connection Management

**DO**:
```python
# Use context manager for automatic cleanup
with get_connection() as conn:
    conn.execute("SELECT * FROM people")
```

**DON'T**:
```python
# Don't manually manage connections
conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
conn.execute("SELECT * FROM people")
# Forgot to close - connection leak!
```

### Transaction Handling

**DO**:
```python
# Context manager handles commit/rollback
with get_connection() as conn:
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO people ...")
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO projects ...")
    # Both committed together
```

**DON'T**:
```python
# Don't use autocommit for multi-statement transactions
with get_connection() as conn:
    conn.isolation_level = None  # Autocommit
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO people ...")
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO projects ...")
    # No transaction - partial failure possible
```

### Error Handling

**DO**:
```python
# Handle specific database errors
try:
    with get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute("INSERT INTO people ...")
except sqlite3.IntegrityError:
    # Handle constraint violation
    pass
except sqlite3.OperationalError:
    # Handle lock timeout or corruption
    pass
```

**DON'T**:
```python
# Don't catch all exceptions
try:
    with get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute("INSERT INTO people ...")
except Exception:
    # Too broad - hides real issues
    pass
```

### Query Optimization

**DO**:
```python
# Use parameterized queries
with get_connection() as conn:
    conn.execute(
        "SELECT * FROM people WHERE name = ?",
        (name,)
    )
```

**DON'T**:
```python
# Don't use string formatting (SQL injection risk)
with get_connection() as conn:
    conn.execute(f"SELECT * FROM people WHERE name = '{name}'")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Locked Errors

**Symptom**: `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`

**Causes**:
- Long-running transaction holding lock
- Timeout exceeded (>30 seconds)
- WAL mode not enabled (pre-October 2025)

**Solutions**:
1. Verify WAL mode is enabled:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 src/virtualoffice/vdos.db "PRAGMA journal_mode;"
   # Should return: wal
   ```

2. Check for long-running transactions:
   ```python
   # Keep transactions short
   with get_connection() as conn:
       # Quick operations only
       conn.execute("INSERT ...")
   ```

3. Restart services if lock persists:
   ```bash
   # Stop all services
   # Delete WAL files if needed
   rm src/virtualoffice/vdos.db-wal
   rm src/virtualoffice/vdos.db-shm
   # Restart services
   ```

### Connection Leaks

**Symptom**: Too many open connections, memory growth

**Causes**:
- Not using context manager
- Exception preventing cleanup
- Long-lived connections

**Solutions**:
1. Always use context manager:
   ```python
   with get_connection() as conn:
       # Connection automatically closed
       pass
   ```

2. Check for leaked connections:
   ```python
   import gc
   import sqlite3
   
   # Force garbage collection
   gc.collect()
   
   # Count sqlite3.Connection objects
   connections = [obj for obj in gc.get_objects() 
                  if isinstance(obj, sqlite3.Connection)]
   print(f"Open connections: {len(connections)}")
   ```

### WAL File Growth

**Symptom**: `vdos.db-wal` file grows large

**Causes**:
- Checkpoint not running
- Long-running read transactions
- High write volume

**Solutions**:
1. Manual checkpoint:
   ```python
   with get_connection() as conn:
       conn.execute("PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)")
   ```

2. Automatic checkpoint (default):
   - Runs when WAL reaches 1000 pages (~4MB)
   - Truncates WAL file after checkpoint

## Migration Guide

### From Direct sqlite3.connect()

**Before**:
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("vdos.db")
conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM people")
results = cursor.fetchall()
conn.close()
```

**After**:
```python
from virtualoffice.common.db import get_connection

with get_connection() as conn:
    cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM people")
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    # Automatic cleanup
```

### From Custom Connection Management

**Before**:
```python
def get_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    return conn

conn = get_db()
try:
    conn.execute("INSERT ...")
    conn.commit()
finally:
    conn.close()
```

**After**:
```python
from virtualoffice.common.db import get_connection

with get_connection() as conn:
    conn.execute("INSERT ...")
    # Automatic commit and cleanup
```
